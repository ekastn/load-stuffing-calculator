		%% Text of abstract
		Manual container loading operations remain inefficient due to reliance on operator experience without decision support tools. This research develops Load \& Stuffing Calculator, a web-based system integrating 3D Bin Packing Problem algorithm with interactive visualization for container loading optimization. The system employs layered architecture separating the packing calculation service from the data management backend, with Three.js-based 3D visualization providing step-by-step loading guidance. Testing across five scenarios (50-300 heterogeneous items) demonstrates consistent 100\% fill rate with volume utilization reaching 55.26\%, while computation time remains under 40 seconds for offline planning requirements. Algorithm comparison confirms Bigger First strategy achieves 42.9\% higher utilization than Smaller First approach. Empirically, this research validates the feasibility of web-based 3D bin packing systems for practical logistics operations. Conceptually, the integration of step playback visualization bridges the gap between algorithmic calculation and physical execution, addressing the limitation of existing tools that lack operational guidance for warehouse staff.
