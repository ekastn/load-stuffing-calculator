   abstract = {The 3D bin packing problem is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem with numerous real-world applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach for solving this problem by integrating a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a genetic algorithm (GA). Our proposed GAN-based GA utilizes the GAN to generate high-quality solutions and improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the GA. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on a set of benchmark instances and compare it with two existing algorithms. The simulation studies demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms both existing algorithms in terms of the number of used bins while achieving comparable computation times. Our proposed algorithm also performs well in terms of solution quality and runtime on instances of different sizes and shapes. We conduct sensitivity analysis and parameter tuning simulations to determine the optimal values for the key parameters of the proposed algorithm. Our results indicate that the proposed algorithm is robust and effective in solving the 3D bin packing problem. The proposed GAN-based GA algorithm and its modifications can be applied to other optimization problems. Our research contributes to the development of efficient and effective algorithms for solving complex optimization problems, particularly in the context of logistics and manufacturing. In summary, the proposed algorithm represents a promising solution to the challenging 3D bin packing problem and has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in combinatorial optimization.},

   abstract = {We tackle the online 3D bin packing problem (3D-BPP), a challenging yet practically useful variant of the classical bin packing problem. In this problem, the items are delivered to the agent without informing the full sequence information. The agent must directly pack these items into the target bin stably without changing their arrival order, and no further adjustment is permitted. Online 3D-BPP can be naturally formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). We adopt deep reinforcement learning, in particular, the on-policy actor-critic framework, to solve this MDP with constrained action space. To learn a practically feasible packing policy, we propose three critical designs. First, we propose an online analysis of packing stability based on a novel stacking tree. It attains a high analysis accuracy while reducing the computational complexity from O(N2) to O(N log N), making it especially suited for reinforcement learning training. Second, we propose a decoupled packing policy learning for different dimensions of placement which enables high-resolution spatial discretization and hence high packing precision. Third, we introduce a reward function that dictates the robot to place items in a far-to-near order and therefore simplifies the collision avoidance in movement planning of the robotic arm. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive discussion on several key implemental issues. The extensive evaluation demonstrates that our learned policy outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly and is practically usable for real-world applications.},

Traditional studies assume that the context of the real space must be accurately perceived and represented. However, disjunctions between the planner and reality are unavoidable in R-3dBPP, especially with low-cost sensors. As far as the author knows, there is no practical solution. In this paper, the above assumption is discarded and the typical types of uncertainties prevalent to guide the design of the algorithms are formulated. A new online bin-packing algorithm is proposed, keeping deformed boxes stacked in close contact with each other, so that the whole pallet is kept stable by friction between the boxes and the container. In order to meet the requirement of close contact under the non-negligible errors from sensors and planners, a compliant-based motion planning system is introduced. It replaces the precision-based feedback with a compliant end-effector and accompanying motion strategies. Last but not least, a complete online bin-packing robot system is developed and the system's performance under the influence of the uncertainties mentioned above through simulation and physical experiments is evaluated.},

   abstract = {Packing products into a pallet or other medium is an unavoidable activity for producing companies. In many cases, packing is based on operator experience and training using packing patterns that have worked before. Automated packing, on the other hand, requires a systematic procedure for devising packing solutions. In the scientific literature, this problem is known as 3D bin packing (3DBP) and many authors have proposed exact and heuristic solutions for many variations of the problem. There is, however, a lack of datasets that can be used to test and validate such solutions. Many of the available datasets use randomly generated products with extremely limited connection to real practice. Furthermore, they contain a reduced number of product configurations and ignore that packing relates to customers’ orders, which have specific relative mixes of products. This paper proposes a software toolbox for generating arbitrarily large datasets for 3DBPP based on real industry data. The toolbox was developed in connection with the analysis of a real dataset from the food and beverages sector, which enabled the creation of several synthetic datasets. The toolbox and the synthetic datasets are publicly available and can be used to generate additional data for testing and validating 3DBP solutions. The industry is increasingly becoming data dependent and driven. The ability to generate good quality synthetic data to support the development of solutions to real industry problems is of extreme importance. This work is a step in that direction in a domain where open data are scarce.},

The research addresses this problem within the context of a real-world industrial scenario and implements several practical constraints including: full shipment, customer positioning requirements, and product geometric interlocking, for increased stability and with the purpose of minimizing the use of plastic wrapping and/or additional supporting surfaces. The main optimization target is to minimize the total number of containers used in the palletization process of custom orders with varying degrees of complexity. The proposed algorithm includes two stages/phases of processing. In the first phase, the algorithm uses constructive heuristics to generate homogeneous product layers. The layers are then stacked to produce blocks, which are then placed on individual containers or pallets. The second phase packs the leftover items using a genetic algorithm. The performance of the proposed solution is benchmarked using real-world industrial data, as well as a more classic academic benchmark. It is demonstrated, across a very large set of orders, that the algorithm always achieves solutions for full palletization of the orders. The analysis shows that the approach is generic and the quality of the solutions generated is relatively even for both small and large, homogeneous and heterogeneous problem instances.},

The proposed approach accounts for six practical constraints inherent in logistics packaging and establishes an optimization model aimed at maximizing container space utilization while adhering to permissible center of gravity deviations. First, a block construction heuristic is employed to preprocess the cargo by aggregating items into larger blocks, thereby significantly reducing problem size and computational complexity. Subsequently, an improved placement strategy, combined with a genetic algorithm, is applied to identify an initial feasible packing layout. Finally, a simulated annealing operator is introduced to further refine the solution through local optimization, thereby obtaining an enhanced loading solutions with improved loading efficiency. Through comparative experiments with other leading algorithms using public datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs on par with existing methods in solving the three-dimensional packing problem for strongly heterogeneous items while satisfying multiple constraints. It is capable of providing high-quality loading solutions for logistics enterprises and offers valuable insights for addressing more realistic container loading problems in future research.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of automating the definition of feasible pallets configurations. This issue is crucial for the competitiveness of logistic companies and is still one of the most difficult problems in internal logistics. In fact, it requires the fast solution of a three-dimensional Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP) with additional logistic specifications that are fundamental in real applications. To this aim, we propose a matheuristics that, given a set of items, provides feasible pallets configurations that satisfy the practical requirements of items' grouping by logistic features, load bearing, stability, height homogeneity, overhang as well as weight limits, and robotized layer picking. The proposed matheuristics combines a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation of the 3D-Single Bin-Size BPP (3D-SBSBPP) and a layer building heuristics. In particular, the feasible pallets configurations are obtained by sequentially solving two MILP sub-problems: the first, given the set of items to be packed, aims at minimizing the unused space in each layer and thus the number of layers; the latter aims at minimizing the number of shipping bins given the set of layers obtained from the first problem. The approach is extensively tested and compared with existing approaches. For its validation we use both realistic data-sets drawn from the literature and real data-sets, obtained from an Italian logistics leader. The resulting outcomes show the effectiveness of the method in providing high-quality bin configurations in short computational times. Note to Practitioners - This work is motivated by the intention of facilitating the transition from Logistics 3.0 to Logistics 4.0 by providing an effective tool to automate bin packing, suitable for automated warehouses. On the one hand, the proposed technique provides stable and compact bin configurations in less than half a minute per bin on average, despite the high computational complexity of the 3D-SBSBPP. On the other hand, the approach allows to consider compatibility constraints for the items (e.g., final customer and category of the items), and the use of robotized layer picking in automated warehouses. In effect, layers composed by only one type of items (i.e., monoitem layers) can be directly picked and placed on the pallet by a robotic arm without the intervention of any operator. Consequently, the adoption of this approach in warehouses could drastically improve the efficiency of the packing process.},

The combination of both has attracted increasing interest in the past decades. Hereby, 2D or 3D items have to be transported from one depot to a given set of customers using a homogeneous fleet of vehicles. Each route must be provided with a feasible packing plan taking various constraints into account. Combining the two optimization problems increases the complexity of the solution approaches, leading to a higher difficulty to check the results for correctness. To support the research progress and to enable transparency of solution structures, this paper provides an overview of recent literature, problem formulations, and best-known solutions. Furthermore, we introduce two open-source tools: The “Solution Validator” checks the feasibility of solutions in terms of considered constraints. The “Visualizer” provides two views and visualizes solutions. In the vehicle routing view, the tour plan and the corresponding schedule are displayed. In the loading view, the position of each item in the cargo space is demonstrated. In both views, it is possible to check the feasibility of the solution and highlight violated items. Besides the combined problem, the tool can be used also for one optimization problem (e.g. vehicle routing problem or container loading). The source codes for both tools are available at GitHub in C++ and Java and can be easily integrated into other researchers’ code.},

Most existing literature have investigated the conventional 3D-BPP, in which the shape of items are typically considered as regular shapes, e.g., rectangular-shaped rigid boxes or cylindrical-shaped containers. However, 3D-BPP for non-rectangular shaped items are quite common in varies delivery schemes, especially in fresh food delivery, and few published studies focusing on these issues. In this paper, we address a novel 3D-BPP variant in which the shape changing factor of non-rectangular and deformable items is incorporated to further enhance the loading efficiency and reduce the operational cost of related companies. Motivated by the compression process of item-loading, we propose a constructive heuristic (i.e., an improved dynamic-volume-based packing algorithm) to solve the studied problem. Experimental results over a set of randomly generated instances reveal that considering shape changing factor is indeed able to achieve higher space utilization than that of conventional schemes, thereby has potential to save packaging and delivering cost, as well as enhance operation efficiency.},

   abstract = {The number of shipped parcels is continuously growing and e-commerce retailers and logistics service providers are seeking to improve logistics, particularly last-mile delivery. Since unused transportation space is a major problem in parcel distribution, one option is to improve the selection of the right parcel size for an order and the optimal packing pattern, which is known as the three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP). Further, the available portfolio of parcel types significantly influences the unused space. Therefore, we introduce the three-dimensional bin selection problem (3D-BSP) to find a portfolio of parcel types for a large set of orders. To solve the 3D-BPP with rotation of items, we propose an efficient mixed-integer linear programming formulation and symmetry-breaking constraints that are also used in the 3D-BSP for the subproblem. To solve large instances of the latter, we introduce a branch-and-repair method that improves branch-and-check. We show that our decomposition allows to relax the majority of binary decision variables in the master problem and avoids weak combinatorial cuts without further lifting. Further, we use problem-specific acceleration techniques. The numerical results based on a real-world online retailer data set show that our reformulation reduces the run time compared with existing mixed-integer linear programs for 3D-BPPs by 30% on average. For the 3D-BSP, the branch-and-repair method reduces the run time by more than two orders of magnitude compared with the mixed-integer programming formulation and can even solve instances with millions of binary decision variables and constraints efficiently.},

   abstract = {Optimizing the order-fulfillment process is crucial to the logistics industry. Replacing experience-based judgment with intelligent methods in the packing process not only improves work efficiency but also eliminates resource wastage. This study focuses on the three-dimensional multiple bin-size bin packing problem with compatible categories (3D-MBSBPPCC) and different size of the boxes. An algorithm is developed to achieve the best packing pattern while minimizing the number of boxes required and the total unused space in the boxes. In the algorithm, we first use the first-fit decreasing algorithm to find an initial solution. Next, the carton configuration algorithm is applied to perform packing and evaluate the solution. Subsequently, a simulated annealing (SA)-based algorithm is employed to improve the solution by moving the products among the subsets of the solution. Finally, hybrid metaheuristics based on both SA and the genetic algorithm, are proposed to improve the solution quality. We tested the proposed packing algorithms on real-world scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are effective in solving 3D-MBSBPPCC.},
