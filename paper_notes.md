Author Guidelines
IT Journal Research and Development

You can use this list to carry out a final check of your submission before you send it to the journal for review.

Is your manuscript adhere to the minimum standards? (written in English; the length of submitted paper is at least 4 pages and no more than 16 pages; use of a tool such as EndNote, Mendeley, or Zotero  for reference management and formatting, and choose IEEE style) 
Is your manuscript written in ITJRD Format ? At this stage, it is essential that you follow every detail of the ITJRD format. Please try to follow the format as closely as possible.
is your title adequate and is your abstract correctly written? The title of paper is max 10 words, without Acronym or abbreviation. The Abstract (MAX 200 WORDS) should be informative and completely self-explanatory (no citation in abstract), provide a clear statement of the problem, the proposed approach or solution, and point out major findings and conclusions.
Authors are suggested to present their articles in the sections structure: Introduction - The Proposed Method/Algorithm/Procedure specifically designed (optional) - Research Method - Results and Discussion - Conclusion. Authors may present complex proofs of theorems or non-obvious proofs of correctness of algorithms after introduction section (obvious theorems & straightforward proofs of existing theorems are NOT needed).
Introduction section: explain the context of the study and state the precise objective. An Introduction should contain the following three parts:
- Background: Authors have to make clear what the context is. Ideally, authors should give an idea of the state-of-the art of the field the report is about.
- The Problem: If there was no problem, there would be no reason for writing a manuscript, and definitely no reason for reading it. So, please tell readers why they should proceed reading. Experience shows that for this part a few lines are often sufficient.
- The Proposed Solution: Now and only now! - authors may outline the contribution of the manuscript. Here authors have to make sure readers point out what are the novel aspects of authors work.
Authors should place the paper in proper context by citing relevant papers. At least, 10 references (recently journal articles) are used in this section.
Method section: the presentation of the experimental methods should be clear and complete in every detail facilitating reproducibility by other scientists.
Results and discussion section: The presentation of results should be simple and straightforward in style. This section report the most important findings, including results of statistical analyses as apropriate and comparisons to other research results. Results given in figures should not be repeated in tables. This is where the author(s) should explain in words what he/she/they discovered in the research. It should be clearly laid out and in a logical sequence. This section should be supported suitable references.
Conclusion section: Summarize sentences the primary outcomes of the study in a paragraph. Are the claims in this section supported by the results, do they seem reasonable? Have the authors indicated how the results relate to expectations and to earlier research? Does the article support or contradict previous theories? Does the conclusion explain how the research has moved the body of scientific knowledge forward?
Language. If an article is poorly written due to grammatical errors, while it may make it more difficult to understand the science.
Please be sure that the manuscript is up to date. The manuscript should have at least 20 references which mostly to related to the topic of the manuscript. All references must be referred to/in the paper. Additionally, at least 80% of references are journals paper and 80% of them are published in the last 5 years.
Is the manuscript clearly written?  Is the article exciting? Does the content flow well from one section to another? Please try to keep your manuscript on the proper level.  It should be easy to understand by well qualified professionals, but at the same time please avoid describing well known facts (use proper references instead). Often manuscripts receive negative reviews because reviewers are not able to understand the manuscript and this is authors' (not reviewers') fault.  Notice, that if reviewers have difficulties, then other readers will face the same problem and there is no reason to publish the manuscript.
Do you have enough references?  We will usually expect a minimum of 15 to 30 references primarily to journal papers, depending on the length of the paper. Citations of textbooks should be used very rarely and citations to web pages should be avoided. All cited papers should be referenced within the text of the manuscript.
Figures and Tables. Relation of Tables or Figures and Text: Because tables and figures supplement the text, all tables and figures should be referenced in the text. Authors also must explain what the reader should look for when using the table or figure. Focus only on the important point the reader should draw from them, and leave the details for the reader to examine on her own.
Figures:
a.    All figures appearing in article must be numbered in the order that they appear in the text.
b.    Each figure must have a caption fully explaining the content
c.    Figure captions are presented as a paragraph starting with the figure number i.e. Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.
d.    Figure captions appear below the figure
e.    Each figure must be fully cited if taken from another article
f.    all figures must be referred to in the body of the article
Tables:
a.    Material that is tabular in nature must appear in a numbered captioned table.
b.    All tables appearing in article must be numbered in the order that they appear in the text.
c.    Each table must have a caption fully explaining the content with the table number  i.e. Table 1, Table 2, etc.
d.    Each column must have a clear and concise heading
e.    Tables are to be presented with single horizontal line under: the table caption, the column headings and at the end of the table.
f.    All tables must be referred to in the body of the article
g.    Each table must be fully cited if taken from another article
Equations

Make sure that placing and numbering of equations are consistent throughout your manuscript.

 (1)

 (2)

Left aligns the equation and put the number of the equation flush-right, using a Right Tab on the right margin. Please reference equations in the text by writing: Eqn. .. (do not use Equation ..) In principle, variables are to be presented in italics.

Each citation should be written in the order of appearance in the text in square brackets. For example, the first citation [1], the second citation [2], and the third and fourth citations [3,4]. When citing multiple sources at once, the preferred method is to list each number separately, in its own brackets, using a comma or dash between numbers, as such: [1], [3], [5] or [4-8]. It is not necessary to mention an author's name, pages used, or date of publication in the in-text citation. Instead, refer to the source with a number in a square bracket, e.g. [9], that will then correspond to the full citation in your reference list. Examples of in-text citations:
This theory was first put forward in 1970 [9]."
Evizal [10] has argued that...
Several recent studies [7], [9], [11-15] have suggested that....
...end of the line for my research [16].
Please be aware that for the final submission of regular paper you will be asked to tailor your paper so the last page is not half empty.
